# PCA For Dimensionality Reduction
In this program, we will implement and test K-means algorithm for clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. We use K-means to perform segmentation/quantization on a color image. We will compute the PCA for a simple data set using SVD, then visualize the PCA for images. 

We will use a dataset of cropped face images called LFW ("Labeled Faces in the Wild"). This face dataset was taken from news articles about 10 years ago. The full data set has thousands of faces, but we will use a small subset here. Since this data set is widely-used, it is installed as part of the sklearn.
