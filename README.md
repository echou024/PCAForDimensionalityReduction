# PCAForDimensionalityReduction
In this program, we will implement and test K-means algorithm for clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. We use K-means to perform segmentation/quantization on a color image. We will compute the PCA for a simple data set using SVD, then visualize the PCA for images.
